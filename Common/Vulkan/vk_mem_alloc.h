	\page quick_start Quick start

	\section quick_start_project_setup Project setup

	Vulkan Memory Allocator comes in form of a single header file.
	You don't need to build it as a separate library project.
	You can add this file directly to your project and submit it to code repository next to your other source files.

	"Single header" doesn't mean that everything is contained in C/C++ declarations,
	like it tends to be in case of inline functions or C++ templates.
	It means that implementation is bundled with interface in a single file and needs to be extracted using preprocessor macro.
	If you don't do it properly, you will get linker errors.

	To do it properly:

	-# Include "vk_mem_alloc.h" file in each CPP file where you want to use the library.
	This includes declarations of all members of the library.
	-# In exacly one CPP file define following macro before this include.
	It enables also internal definitions.

	\code
	#define VMA_IMPLEMENTATION
	#include "vk_mem_alloc.h"
	\endcode

	It may be a good idea to create dedicated CPP file just for this purpose.

	\section quick_start_initialization Initialization

	At program startup:

	-# Initialize Vulkan to have `VkPhysicalDevice` and `VkDevice` object.
	-# Fill VmaAllocatorCreateInfo structure and create #VmaAllocator object by
	calling vmaCreateAllocator().

	\code
	VmaAllocatorCreateInfo allocatorInfo = {};
	allocatorInfo.physicalDevice = physicalDevice;
	allocatorInfo.device = device;

	VmaAllocator allocator;
	vmaCreateAllocator(&allocatorInfo, &allocator);
	\endcode

	\section quick_start_resource_allocation Resource allocation

	When you want to create a buffer or image:

	-# Fill `VkBufferCreateInfo` / `VkImageCreateInfo` structure.
	-# Fill VmaAllocationCreateInfo structure.
	-# Call vmaCreateBuffer() / vmaCreateImage() to get `VkBuffer`/`VkImage` with memory
	already allocated and bound to it.

	\code
	VkBufferCreateInfo bufferInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };
	bufferInfo.size = 65536;
	bufferInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_VERTEX_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT;

	VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocInfo = {};
	allocInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY;

	VkBuffer buffer;
	VmaAllocation allocation;
	vmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufferInfo, &allocInfo, &buffer, &allocation, nullptr);
	\endcode

	Don't forget to destroy your objects when no longer needed:

	\code
	vmaDestroyBuffer(allocator, buffer, allocation);
	vmaDestroyAllocator(allocator);
	\endcode


	\page choosing_memory_type Choosing memory type

	Physical devices in Vulkan support various combinations of memory heaps and
	types. Help with choosing correct and optimal memory type for your specific
	resource is one of the key features of this library. You can use it by filling
	appropriate members of VmaAllocationCreateInfo structure, as described below.
	You can also combine multiple methods.

	-# If you just want to find memory type index that meets your requirements, you
	can use function vmaFindMemoryTypeIndex().
	-# If you want to allocate a region of device memory without association with any
	specific image or buffer, you can use function vmaAllocateMemory(). Usage of
	this function is not recommended and usually not needed.
	-# If you already have a buffer or an image created, you want to allocate memory
	for it and then you will bind it yourself, you can use function
	vmaAllocateMemoryForBuffer(), vmaAllocateMemoryForImage().
	For binding you should use functions: vmaBindBufferMemory(), vmaBindImageMemory().
	-# If you want to create a buffer or an image, allocate memory for it and bind
	them together, all in one call, you can use function vmaCreateBuffer(),
	vmaCreateImage(). This is the recommended way to use this library.

	When using 3. or 4., the library internally queries Vulkan for memory types
	supported for that buffer or image (function `vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements()`)
	and uses only one of these types.

	If no memory type can be found that meets all the requirements, these functions
	return `VK_ERROR_FEATURE_NOT_PRESENT`.

	You can leave VmaAllocationCreateInfo structure completely filled with zeros.
	It means no requirements are specified for memory type.
	It is valid, although not very useful.

	\section choosing_memory_type_usage Usage

	The easiest way to specify memory requirements is to fill member
	VmaAllocationCreateInfo::usage using one of the values of enum #VmaMemoryUsage.
	It defines high level, common usage types.
	For more details, see description of this enum.

	For example, if you want to create a uniform buffer that will be filled using
	transfer only once or infrequently and used for rendering every frame, you can
	do it using following code:

	\code
	VkBufferCreateInfo bufferInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };
	bufferInfo.size = 65536;
	bufferInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT;

	VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocInfo = {};
	allocInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY;

	VkBuffer buffer;
	VmaAllocation allocation;
	vmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufferInfo, &allocInfo, &buffer, &allocation, nullptr);
	\endcode

	\section choosing_memory_type_required_preferred_flags Required and preferred flags

	You can specify more detailed requirements by filling members
	VmaAllocationCreateInfo::requiredFlags and VmaAllocationCreateInfo::preferredFlags
	with a combination of bits from enum `VkMemoryPropertyFlags`. For example,
	if you want to create a buffer that will be persistently mapped on host (so it
	must be `HOST_VISIBLE`) and preferably will also be `HOST_COHERENT` and `HOST_CACHED`,
	use following code:

	\code
	VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocInfo = {};
	allocInfo.requiredFlags = VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT;
	allocInfo.preferredFlags = VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT;
	allocInfo.flags = VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_MAPPED_BIT;

	VkBuffer buffer;
	VmaAllocation allocation;
	vmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufferInfo, &allocInfo, &buffer, &allocation, nullptr);
	\endcode

	A memory type is chosen that has all the required flags and as many preferred
	flags set as possible.

	If you use VmaAllocationCreateInfo::usage, it is just internally converted to
	a set of required and preferred flags.

	\section choosing_memory_type_explicit_memory_types Explicit memory types

	If you inspected memory types available on the physical device and you have
	a preference for memory types that you want to use, you can fill member
	VmaAllocationCreateInfo::memoryTypeBits. It is a bit mask, where each bit set
	means that a memory type with that index is allowed to be used for the
	allocation. Special value 0, just like `UINT32_MAX`, means there are no
	restrictions to memory type index.

	Please note that this member is NOT just a memory type index.
	Still you can use it to choose just one, specific memory type.
	For example, if you already determined that your buffer should be created in
	memory type 2, use following code:

	\code
	uint32_t memoryTypeIndex = 2;

	VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocInfo = {};
	allocInfo.memoryTypeBits = 1u << memoryTypeIndex;

	VkBuffer buffer;
	VmaAllocation allocation;
	vmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufferInfo, &allocInfo, &buffer, &allocation, nullptr);
	\endcode

	\section choosing_memory_type_custom_memory_pools Custom memory pools

	If you allocate from custom memory pool, all the ways of specifying memory
	requirements described above are not applicable and the aforementioned members
	of VmaAllocationCreateInfo structure are ignored. Memory type is selected
	explicitly when creating the pool and then used to make all the allocations from
	that pool. For further details, see \ref custom_memory_pools.


	\page memory_mapping Memory mapping

	To "map memory" in Vulkan means to obtain a CPU pointer to `VkDeviceMemory`,
	to be able to read from it or write to it in CPU code.
	Mapping is possible only of memory allocated from a memory type that has
	`VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT` flag.
	Functions `vkMapMemory()`, `vkUnmapMemory()` are designed for this purpose.
	You can use them directly with memory allocated by this library,
	but it is not recommended because of following issue:
	Mapping the same `VkDeviceMemory` block multiple times is illegal - only one mapping at a time is allowed.
	This includes mapping disjoint regions. Mapping is not reference-counted internally by Vulkan.
	Because of this, Vulkan Memory Allocator provides following facilities:

	\section memory_mapping_mapping_functions Mapping functions

	The library provides following functions for mapping of a specific #VmaAllocation: vmaMapMemory(), vmaUnmapMemory().
	They are safer and more convenient to use than standard Vulkan functions.
	You can map an allocation multiple times simultaneously - mapping is reference-counted internally.
	You can also map different allocations simultaneously regardless of whether they use the same `VkDeviceMemory` block.
	They way it's implemented is that the library always maps entire memory block, not just region of the allocation.
	For further details, see description of vmaMapMemory() function.
	Example:

	\code
	// Having these objects initialized:

	struct ConstantBuffer
	{
	...
	};
	ConstantBuffer constantBufferData;

	VmaAllocator allocator;
	VmaBuffer constantBuffer;
	VmaAllocation constantBufferAllocation;

	// You can map and fill your buffer using following code:

	void* mappedData;
	vmaMapMemory(allocator, constantBufferAllocation, &mappedData);
	memcpy(mappedData, &constantBufferData, sizeof(constantBufferData));
	vmaUnmapMemory(allocator, constantBufferAllocation);
	\endcode

	\section memory_mapping_persistently_mapped_memory Persistently mapped memory

	Kepping your memory persistently mapped is generally OK in Vulkan.
	You don't need to unmap it before using its data on the GPU.
	The library provides a special feature designed for that:
	Allocations made with #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_MAPPED_BIT flag set in
	VmaAllocationCreateInfo::flags stay mapped all the time,
	so you can just access CPU pointer to it any time
	without a need to call any "map" or "unmap" function.
	Example:

	\code
	VkBufferCreateInfo bufCreateInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };
	bufCreateInfo.size = sizeof(ConstantBuffer);
	bufCreateInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT;

	VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};
	allocCreateInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_ONLY;
	allocCreateInfo.flags = VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_MAPPED_BIT;

	VkBuffer buf;
	VmaAllocation alloc;
	VmaAllocationInfo allocInfo;
	vmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufCreateInfo, &allocCreateInfo, &buf, &alloc, &allocInfo);

	// Buffer is already mapped. You can access its memory.
	memcpy(allocInfo.pMappedData, &constantBufferData, sizeof(constantBufferData));
	\endcode

	There are some exceptions though, when you should consider mapping memory only for a short period of time:

	- When operating system is Windows 7 or 8.x (Windows 10 is not affected because it uses WDDM2),
	device is discrete AMD GPU,
	and memory type is the special 256 MiB pool of `DEVICE_LOCAL + HOST_VISIBLE` memory
	(selected when you use #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_TO_GPU),
	then whenever a memory block allocated from this memory type stays mapped
	for the time of any call to `vkQueueSubmit()` or `vkQueuePresentKHR()`, this
	block is migrated by WDDM to system RAM, which degrades performance. It doesn't
	matter if that particular memory block is actually used by the command buffer
	being submitted.
	- Keeping many large memory blocks mapped may impact performance or stability of some debugging tools.

	\section memory_mapping_cache_control Cache control

	Memory in Vulkan doesn't need to be unmapped before using it on GPU,
	but unless a memory types has `VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT` flag set,
	you need to manually invalidate cache before reading of mapped pointer
	using function `vkvkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges()`
	and flush cache after writing to mapped pointer
	using function `vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges()`.
	Example:

	\code
	memcpy(allocInfo.pMappedData, &constantBufferData, sizeof(constantBufferData));

	VkMemoryPropertyFlags memFlags;
	vmaGetMemoryTypeProperties(allocator, allocInfo.memoryType, &memFlags);
	if((memFlags & VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT) == 0)
	{
	VkMappedMemoryRange memRange = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_MAPPED_MEMORY_RANGE };
	memRange.memory = allocInfo.deviceMemory;
	memRange.offset = allocInfo.offset;
	memRange.size   = allocInfo.size;
	vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges(device, 1, &memRange);
	}
	\endcode

	Please note that memory allocated with #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_ONLY is guaranteed to be host coherent.

	Also, Windows drivers from all 3 PC GPU vendors (AMD, Intel, NVIDIA)
	currently provide `VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT` flag on all memory types that are
	`VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT`, so on this platform you may not need to bother.

	\section memory_mapping_finding_if_memory_mappable Finding out if memory is mappable

	It may happen that your allocation ends up in memory that is `HOST_VISIBLE` (available for mapping)
	despite it wasn't explicitly requested.
	For example, application may work on integrated graphics with unified memory (like Intel) or
	allocation from video memory might have failed, so the library chose system memory as fallback.

	You can detect this case and map such allocation to access its memory on CPU directly,
	instead of launching a transfer operation.
	In order to do that: inspect `allocInfo.memoryType`, call vmaGetMemoryTypeProperties(),
	and look for `VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT` flag in properties of that memory type.

	\code
	VkBufferCreateInfo bufCreateInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };
	bufCreateInfo.size = sizeof(ConstantBuffer);
	bufCreateInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT;

	VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};
	allocCreateInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY;
	allocCreateInfo.preferredFlags = VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT;

	VkBuffer buf;
	VmaAllocation alloc;
	VmaAllocationInfo allocInfo;
	vmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufCreateInfo, &allocCreateInfo, &buf, &alloc, &allocInfo);

	VkMemoryPropertyFlags memFlags;
	vmaGetMemoryTypeProperties(allocator, allocInfo.memoryType, &memFlags);
	if((memFlags & VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT) == 0)
	{
	// Allocation ended up in mappable memory. You can map it and access it directly.
	void* mappedData;
	vmaMapMemory(allocator, alloc, &mappedData);
	memcpy(mappedData, &constantBufferData, sizeof(constantBufferData));
	vmaUnmapMemory(allocator, alloc);
	}
	else
	{
	// Allocation ended up in non-mappable memory.
	// You need to create CPU-side buffer in VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_ONLY and make a transfer.
	}
	\endcode

	You can even use #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_MAPPED_BIT flag while creating allocations
	that are not necessarily `HOST_VISIBLE` (e.g. using #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY).
	If the allocation ends up in memory type that is `HOST_VISIBLE`, it will be persistently mapped and you can use it directly.
	If not, the flag is just ignored.
	Example:

	\code
	VkBufferCreateInfo bufCreateInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };
	bufCreateInfo.size = sizeof(ConstantBuffer);
	bufCreateInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT;

	VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};
	allocCreateInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY;
	allocCreateInfo.flags = VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_MAPPED_BIT;

	VkBuffer buf;
	VmaAllocation alloc;
	VmaAllocationInfo allocInfo;
	vmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufCreateInfo, &allocCreateInfo, &buf, &alloc, &allocInfo);

	if(allocInfo.pUserData != nullptr)
	{
	// Allocation ended up in mappable memory.
	// It's persistently mapped. You can access it directly.
	memcpy(allocInfo.pMappedData, &constantBufferData, sizeof(constantBufferData));
	}
	else
	{
	// Allocation ended up in non-mappable memory.
	// You need to create CPU-side buffer in VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_ONLY and make a transfer.
	}
	\endcode


	\page custom_memory_pools Custom memory pools

	A memory pool contains a number of `VkDeviceMemory` blocks.
	The library automatically creates and manages default pool for each memory type available on the device.
	Default memory pool automatically grows in size.
	Size of allocated blocks is also variable and managed automatically.

	You can create custom pool and allocate memory out of it.
	It can be useful if you want to:

	- Keep certain kind of allocations separate from others.
	- Enforce particular, fixed size of Vulkan memory blocks.
	- Limit maximum amount of Vulkan memory allocated for that pool.
	- Reserve minimum or fixed amount of Vulkan memory always preallocated for that pool.

	To use custom memory pools:

	-# Fill VmaPoolCreateInfo structure.
	-# Call vmaCreatePool() to obtain #VmaPool handle.
	-# When making an allocation, set VmaAllocationCreateInfo::pool to this handle.
	You don't need to specify any other parameters of this structure, like usage.

	Example:

	\code
	// Create a pool that can have at most 2 blocks, 128 MiB each.
	VmaPoolCreateInfo poolCreateInfo = {};
	poolCreateInfo.memoryTypeIndex = ...
	poolCreateInfo.blockSize = 128ull * 1024 * 1024;
	poolCreateInfo.maxBlockCount = 2;

	VmaPool pool;
	vmaCreatePool(allocator, &poolCreateInfo, &pool);

	// Allocate a buffer out of it.
	VkBufferCreateInfo bufCreateInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };
	bufCreateInfo.size = 1024;
	bufCreateInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT;

	VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};
	allocCreateInfo.pool = pool;

	VkBuffer buf;
	VmaAllocation alloc;
	VmaAllocationInfo allocInfo;
	vmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufCreateInfo, &allocCreateInfo, &buf, &alloc, &allocInfo);
	\endcode

	You have to free all allocations made from this pool before destroying it.

	\code
	vmaDestroyBuffer(allocator, buf, alloc);
	vmaDestroyPool(allocator, pool);
	\endcode

	\section custom_memory_pools_MemTypeIndex Choosing memory type index

	When creating a pool, you must explicitly specify memory type index.
	To find the one suitable for your buffers or images, you can use helper functions
	vmaFindMemoryTypeIndexForBufferInfo(), vmaFindMemoryTypeIndexForImageInfo().
	You need to provide structures with example parameters of buffers or images
	that you are going to create in that pool.

	\code
	VkBufferCreateInfo exampleBufCreateInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };
	exampleBufCreateInfo.size = 1024; // Whatever.
	exampleBufCreateInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT; // Change if needed.

	VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};
	allocCreateInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY; // Change if needed.

	uint32_t memTypeIndex;
	vmaFindMemoryTypeIndexForBufferInfo(allocator, &exampleBufCreateInfo, &allocCreateInfo, &memTypeIndex);

	VmaPoolCreateInfo poolCreateInfo = {};
	poolCreateInfo.memoryTypeIndex = memTypeIndex;
	// ...
	\endcode

	When creating buffers/images allocated in that pool, provide following parameters:

	- `VkBufferCreateInfo`: Prefer to pass same parameters as above.
	Otherwise you risk creating resources in a memory type that is not suitable for them, which may result in undefined behavior.
	Using different `VK_BUFFER_USAGE_` flags may work, but you shouldn't create images in a pool intended for buffers
	or the other way around.
	- VmaAllocationCreateInfo: You don't need to pass same parameters. Fill only `pool` member.
	Other members are ignored anyway.


	\page defragmentation Defragmentation

	Interleaved allocations and deallocations of many objects of varying size can
	cause fragmentation, which can lead to a situation where the library is unable
	to find a continuous range of free memory for a new allocation despite there is
	enough free space, just scattered across many small free ranges between existing
	allocations.

	To mitigate this problem, you can use vmaDefragment(). Given set of allocations,
	this function can move them to compact used memory, ensure more continuous free
	space and possibly also free some `VkDeviceMemory`. It can work only on
	allocations made from memory type that is `HOST_VISIBLE`. Allocations are
	modified to point to the new `VkDeviceMemory` and offset. Data in this memory is
	also `memmove`-ed to the new place. However, if you have images or buffers bound
	to these allocations (and you certainly do), you need to destroy, recreate, and
	bind them to the new place in memory.

	For further details and example code, see documentation of function
	vmaDefragment().

	\page lost_allocations Lost allocations

	If your game oversubscribes video memory, if may work OK in previous-generation
	graphics APIs (DirectX 9, 10, 11, OpenGL) because resources are automatically
	paged to system RAM. In Vulkan you can't do it because when you run out of
	memory, an allocation just fails. If you have more data (e.g. textures) that can
	fit into VRAM and you don't need it all at once, you may want to upload them to
	GPU on demand and "push out" ones that are not used for a long time to make room
	for the new ones, effectively using VRAM (or a cartain memory pool) as a form of
	cache. Vulkan Memory Allocator can help you with that by supporting a concept of
	"lost allocations".

	To create an allocation that can become lost, include #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_BECOME_LOST_BIT
	flag in VmaAllocationCreateInfo::flags. Before using a buffer or image bound to
	such allocation in every new frame, you need to query it if it's not lost.
	To check it, call vmaTouchAllocation().
	If the allocation is lost, you should not use it or buffer/image bound to it.
	You mustn't forget to destroy this allocation and this buffer/image.
	vmaGetAllocationInfo() can also be used for checking status of the allocation.
	Allocation is lost when returned VmaAllocationInfo::deviceMemory == `VK_NULL_HANDLE`.

	To create an allocation that can make some other allocations lost to make room
	for it, use #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_MAKE_OTHER_LOST_BIT flag. You will
	usually use both flags #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_MAKE_OTHER_LOST_BIT and
	#VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_BECOME_LOST_BIT at the same time.

	Warning! Current implementation uses quite naive, brute force algorithm,
	which can make allocation calls that use #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_MAKE_OTHER_LOST_BIT
	flag quite slow. A new, more optimal algorithm and data structure to speed this
	up is planned for the future.

	<b>Q: When interleaving creation of new allocations with usage of existing ones,
	how do you make sure that an allocation won't become lost while it's used in the
	current frame?</b>

	It is ensured because vmaTouchAllocation() / vmaGetAllocationInfo() not only returns allocation
	status/parameters and checks whether it's not lost, but when it's not, it also
	atomically marks it as used in the current frame, which makes it impossible to
	become lost in that frame. It uses lockless algorithm, so it works fast and
	doesn't involve locking any internal mutex.

	<b>Q: What if my allocation may still be in use by the GPU when it's rendering a
	previous frame while I already submit new frame on the CPU?</b>

	You can make sure that allocations "touched" by vmaTouchAllocation() / vmaGetAllocationInfo() will not
	become lost for a number of additional frames back from the current one by
	specifying this number as VmaAllocatorCreateInfo::frameInUseCount (for default
	memory pool) and VmaPoolCreateInfo::frameInUseCount (for custom pool).

	<b>Q: How do you inform the library when new frame starts?</b>

	You need to call function vmaSetCurrentFrameIndex().

	Example code:

	\code
	struct MyBuffer
	{
	VkBuffer m_Buf = nullptr;
	VmaAllocation m_Alloc = nullptr;

	// Called when the buffer is really needed in the current frame.
	void EnsureBuffer();
	};

	void MyBuffer::EnsureBuffer()
	{
	// Buffer has been created.
	if(m_Buf != VK_NULL_HANDLE)
	{
	// Check if its allocation is not lost + mark it as used in current frame.
	if(vmaTouchAllocation(allocator, m_Alloc))
	{
	// It's all OK - safe to use m_Buf.
	return;
	}
	}

	// Buffer not yet exists or lost - destroy and recreate it.

	vmaDestroyBuffer(allocator, m_Buf, m_Alloc);

	VkBufferCreateInfo bufCreateInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };
	bufCreateInfo.size = 1024;
	bufCreateInfo.usage = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT;

	VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};
	allocCreateInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY;
	allocCreateInfo.flags = VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_BECOME_LOST_BIT |
	VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_MAKE_OTHER_LOST_BIT;

	vmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufCreateInfo, &allocCreateInfo, &m_Buf, &m_Alloc, nullptr);
	}
	\endcode

	When using lost allocations, you may see some Vulkan validation layer warnings
	about overlapping regions of memory bound to different kinds of buffers and
	images. This is still valid as long as you implement proper handling of lost
	allocations (like in the example above) and don't use them.

	You can create an allocation that is already in lost state from the beginning using function
	vmaCreateLostAllocation(). It may be useful if you need a "dummy" allocation that is not null.

	You can call function vmaMakePoolAllocationsLost() to set all eligible allocations
	in a specified custom pool to lost state.
	Allocations that have been "touched" in current frame or VmaPoolCreateInfo::frameInUseCount frames back
	cannot become lost.

	<b>Q: Can I touch allocation that cannot become lost?</b>

	Yes, although it has no visible effect.
	Calls to vmaGetAllocationInfo() and vmaTouchAllocation() update last use frame index
	also for allocations that cannot become lost, but the only way to observe it is to dump
	internal allocator state using vmaBuildStatsString().
	You can use this feature for debugging purposes to explicitly mark allocations that you use
	in current frame and then analyze JSON dump to see for how long each allocation stays unused.


	\page statistics Statistics

	This library contains functions that return information about its internal state,
	especially the amount of memory allocated from Vulkan.
	Please keep in mind that these functions need to traverse all internal data structures
	to gather these information, so they may be quite time-consuming.
	Don't call them too often.

	\section statistics_numeric_statistics Numeric statistics

	You can query for overall statistics of the allocator using function vmaCalculateStats().
	Information are returned using structure #VmaStats.
	It contains #VmaStatInfo - number of allocated blocks, number of allocations
	(occupied ranges in these blocks), number of unused (free) ranges in these blocks,
	number of bytes used and unused (but still allocated from Vulkan) and other information.
	They are summed across memory heaps, memory types and total for whole allocator.

	You can query for statistics of a custom pool using function vmaGetPoolStats().
	Information are returned using structure #VmaPoolStats.

	You can query for information about specific allocation using function vmaGetAllocationInfo().
	It fill structure #VmaAllocationInfo.

	\section statistics_json_dump JSON dump

	You can dump internal state of the allocator to a string in JSON format using function vmaBuildStatsString().
	The result is guaranteed to be correct JSON.
	It uses ANSI encoding.
	Any strings provided by user (see [Allocation names](@ref allocation_names))
	are copied as-is and properly escaped for JSON, so if they use UTF-8, ISO-8859-2 or any other encoding,
	this JSON string can be treated as using this encoding.
	It must be freed using function vmaFreeStatsString().

	The format of this JSON string is not part of official documentation of the library,
	but it will not change in backward-incompatible way without increasing library major version number
	and appropriate mention in changelog.

	The JSON string contains all the data that can be obtained using vmaCalculateStats().
	It can also contain detailed map of allocated memory blocks and their regions -
	free and occupied by allocations.
	This allows e.g. to visualize the memory or assess fragmentation.


	\page allocation_annotation Allocation names and user data

	\section allocation_user_data Allocation user data

	You can annotate allocations with your own information, e.g. for debugging purposes.
	To do that, fill VmaAllocationCreateInfo::pUserData field when creating
	an allocation. It's an opaque `void*` pointer. You can use it e.g. as a pointer,
	some handle, index, key, ordinal number or any other value that would associate
	the allocation with your custom metadata.

	\code
	VkBufferCreateInfo bufferInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_CREATE_INFO };
	// Fill bufferInfo...

	MyBufferMetadata* pMetadata = CreateBufferMetadata();

	VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};
	allocCreateInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY;
	allocCreateInfo.pUserData = pMetadata;

	VkBuffer buffer;
	VmaAllocation allocation;
	vmaCreateBuffer(allocator, &bufferInfo, &allocCreateInfo, &buffer, &allocation, nullptr);
	\endcode

	The pointer may be later retrieved as VmaAllocationInfo::pUserData:

	\code
	VmaAllocationInfo allocInfo;
	vmaGetAllocationInfo(allocator, allocation, &allocInfo);
	MyBufferMetadata* pMetadata = (MyBufferMetadata*)allocInfo.pUserData;
	\endcode

	It can also be changed using function vmaSetAllocationUserData().

	Values of (non-zero) allocations' `pUserData` are printed in JSON report created by
	vmaBuildStatsString(), in hexadecimal form.

	\section allocation_names Allocation names

	There is alternative mode available where `pUserData` pointer is used to point to
	a null-terminated string, giving a name to the allocation. To use this mode,
	set #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_USER_DATA_COPY_STRING_BIT flag in VmaAllocationCreateInfo::flags.
	Then `pUserData` passed as VmaAllocationCreateInfo::pUserData or argument to
	vmaSetAllocationUserData() must be either null or pointer to a null-terminated string.
	The library creates internal copy of the string, so the pointer you pass doesn't need
	to be valid for whole lifetime of the allocation. You can free it after the call.

	\code
	VkImageCreateInfo imageInfo = { VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_IMAGE_CREATE_INFO };
	// Fill imageInfo...

	std::string imageName = "Texture: ";
	imageName += fileName;

	VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo = {};
	allocCreateInfo.usage = VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY;
	allocCreateInfo.flags = VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_USER_DATA_COPY_STRING_BIT;
	allocCreateInfo.pUserData = imageName.c_str();

	VkImage image;
	VmaAllocation allocation;
	vmaCreateImage(allocator, &imageInfo, &allocCreateInfo, &image, &allocation, nullptr);
	\endcode

	The value of `pUserData` pointer of the allocation will be different than the one
	you passed when setting allocation's name - pointing to a buffer managed
	internally that holds copy of the string.

	\code
	VmaAllocationInfo allocInfo;
	vmaGetAllocationInfo(allocator, allocation, &allocInfo);
	const char* imageName = (const char*)allocInfo.pUserData;
	printf("Image name: %s\n", imageName);
	\endcode

	That string is also printed in JSON report created by vmaBuildStatsString().

	\section usage_patterns_simple Simple patterns

	\subsection usage_patterns_simple_render_targets Render targets

	<b>When:</b>
	Any resources that you frequently write and read on GPU,
	e.g. images used as color attachments (aka "render targets"), depth-stencil attachments,
	images/buffers used as storage image/buffer (aka "Unordered Access View (UAV)").

	<b>What to do:</b>
	Create them in video memory that is fastest to access from GPU using
	#VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY.

	Consider using [VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation](@ref vk_khr_dedicated_allocation) extension
	and/or manually creating them as dedicated allocations using #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_DEDICATED_MEMORY_BIT,
	especially if they are large or if you plan to destroy and recreate them e.g. when
	display resolution changes.
	Prefer to create such resources first and all other GPU resources (like textures and vertex buffers) later.

	\subsection usage_patterns_simple_immutable_resources Immutable resources

	<b>When:</b>
	Any resources that you fill on CPU only once (aka "immutable") or infrequently
	and then read frequently on GPU,
	e.g. textures, vertex and index buffers, constant buffers that don't change often.

	<b>What to do:</b>
	Create them in video memory that is fastest to access from GPU using
	#VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY.

	To initialize content of such resource, create a CPU-side (aka "staging") copy of it
	in system memory - #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_ONLY, map it, fill it,
	and submit a transfer from it to the GPU resource.
	You can keep the staging copy if you need it for another upload transfer in the future.
	If you don't, you can destroy it or reuse this buffer for uploading different resource
	after the transfer finishes.

	Prefer to create just buffers in system memory rather than images, even for uploading textures.
	Use `vkCmdCopyBufferToImage()`.
	Dont use images with `VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR`.

	\subsection usage_patterns_dynamic_resources Dynamic resources

	<b>When:</b>
	Any resources that change frequently (aka "dynamic"), e.g. every frame or every draw call,
	written on CPU, read on GPU.

	<b>What to do:</b>
	Create them using #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_TO_GPU.
	You can map it and write to it directly on CPU, as well as read from it on GPU.

	This is a more complex situation. Different solutions are possible,
	and the best one depends on specific GPU type, but you can use this simple approach for the start.
	Prefer to write to such resource sequentially (e.g. using `memcpy`).
	Don't perform random access or any reads from it, as it may be very slow.

	\subsection usage_patterns_readback Readback

	<b>When:</b>
	Resources that contain data written by GPU that you want to read back on CPU,
	e.g. results of some computations.

	<b>What to do:</b>
	Create them using #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_TO_CPU.
	You can write to them directly on GPU, as well as map and read them on CPU.

	\section usage_patterns_advanced Advanced patterns

	\subsection usage_patterns_integrated_graphics Detecting integrated graphics

	You can support integrated graphics (like Intel HD Graphics, AMD APU) better
	by detecting it in Vulkan.
	To do it, call `vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties()`, inspect
	`VkPhysicalDeviceProperties::deviceType` and look for `VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_INTEGRATED_GPU`.
	When you find it, you can assume that memory is unified and all memory types are equally fast
	to access from GPU, regardless of `VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT`.

	You can then sum up sizes of all available memory heaps and treat them as useful for
	your GPU resources, instead of only `DEVICE_LOCAL` ones.
	You can also prefer to create your resources in memory types that are `HOST_VISIBLE` to map them
	directly instead of submitting explicit transfer (see below).

	\subsection usage_patterns_direct_vs_transfer Direct access versus transfer

	For resources that you frequently write on CPU and read on GPU, many solutions are possible:

	-# Create one copy in video memory using #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY,
	second copy in system memory using #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_ONLY and submit explicit tranfer each time.
	-# Create just single copy using #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_TO_GPU, map it and fill it on CPU,
	read it directly on GPU.
	-# Create just single copy using #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_CPU_ONLY, map it and fill it on CPU,
	read it directly on GPU.

	Which solution is the most efficient depends on your resource and especially on the GPU.
	It is best to measure it and then make the decision.
	Some general recommendations:

	- On integrated graphics use (2) or (3) to avoid unnecesary time and memory overhead
	related to using a second copy.
	- For small resources (e.g. constant buffers) use (2).
	Discrete AMD cards have special 256 MiB pool of video memory that is directly mappable.
	Even if the resource ends up in system memory, its data may be cached on GPU after first
	fetch over PCIe bus.
	- For larger resources (e.g. textures), decide between (1) and (2).
	You may want to differentiate NVIDIA and AMD, e.g. by looking for memory type that is
	both `DEVICE_LOCAL` and `HOST_VISIBLE`. When you find it, use (2), otherwise use (1).

	Similarly, for resources that you frequently write on GPU and read on CPU, multiple
	solutions are possible:

	-# Create one copy in video memory using #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_ONLY,
	second copy in system memory using #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_TO_CPU and submit explicit tranfer each time.
	-# Create just single copy using #VMA_MEMORY_USAGE_GPU_TO_CPU, write to it directly on GPU,
	map it and read it on CPU.

	You should take some measurements to decide which option is faster in case of your specific
	resource.

	If you don't want to specialize your code for specific types of GPUs, you can still make
	an simple optimization for cases when your resource ends up in mappable memory to use it
	directly in this case instead of creating CPU-side staging copy.
	For details see [Finding out if memory is mappable](@ref memory_mapping_finding_if_memory_mappable).


	\page configuration Configuration

	Please check "CONFIGURATION SECTION" in the code to find macros that you can define
	before each include of this file or change directly in this file to provide
	your own implementation of basic facilities like assert, `min()` and `max()` functions,
	mutex, atomic etc.
	The library uses its own implementation of containers by default, but you can switch to using
	STL containers instead.

	\section config_Vulkan_functions Pointers to Vulkan functions

	The library uses Vulkan functions straight from the `vulkan.h` header by default.
	If you want to provide your own pointers to these functions, e.g. fetched using
	`vkGetInstanceProcAddr()` and `vkGetDeviceProcAddr()`:

	-# Define `VMA_STATIC_VULKAN_FUNCTIONS 0`.
	-# Provide valid pointers through VmaAllocatorCreateInfo::pVulkanFunctions.

	\section custom_memory_allocator Custom host memory allocator

	If you use custom allocator for CPU memory rather than default operator `new`
	and `delete` from C++, you can make this library using your allocator as well
	by filling optional member VmaAllocatorCreateInfo::pAllocationCallbacks. These
	functions will be passed to Vulkan, as well as used by the library itself to
	make any CPU-side allocations.

	\section allocation_callbacks Device memory allocation callbacks

	The library makes calls to `vkAllocateMemory()` and `vkFreeMemory()` internally.
	You can setup callbacks to be informed about these calls, e.g. for the purpose
	of gathering some statistics. To do it, fill optional member
	VmaAllocatorCreateInfo::pDeviceMemoryCallbacks.

	\section heap_memory_limit Device heap memory limit

	If you want to test how your program behaves with limited amount of Vulkan device
	memory available without switching your graphics card to one that really has
	smaller VRAM, you can use a feature of this library intended for this purpose.
	To do it, fill optional member VmaAllocatorCreateInfo::pHeapSizeLimit.



	\page vk_khr_dedicated_allocation VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation

	VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation is a Vulkan extension which can be used to improve
	performance on some GPUs. It augments Vulkan API with possibility to query
	driver whether it prefers particular buffer or image to have its own, dedicated
	allocation (separate `VkDeviceMemory` block) for better efficiency - to be able
	to do some internal optimizations.

	The extension is supported by this library. It will be used automatically when
	enabled. To enable it:

	1 . When creating Vulkan device, check if following 2 device extensions are
	supported (call `vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties()`).
	If yes, enable them (fill `VkDeviceCreateInfo::ppEnabledExtensionNames`).

	- VK_KHR_get_memory_requirements2
	- VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation

	If you enabled these extensions:

	2 . Use #VMA_ALLOCATOR_CREATE_KHR_DEDICATED_ALLOCATION_BIT flag when creating
	your #VmaAllocator`to inform the library that you enabled required extensions
	and you want the library to use them.

	\code
	allocatorInfo.flags |= VMA_ALLOCATOR_CREATE_KHR_DEDICATED_ALLOCATION_BIT;

	vmaCreateAllocator(&allocatorInfo, &allocator);
	\endcode

	That's all. The extension will be automatically used whenever you create a
	buffer using vmaCreateBuffer() or image using vmaCreateImage().

	When using the extension together with Vulkan Validation Layer, you will receive
	warnings like this:

	vkBindBufferMemory(): Binding memory to buffer 0x33 but vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements() has not been called on that buffer.

	It is OK, you should just ignore it. It happens because you use function
	`vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements2KHR()` instead of standard
	`vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements()`, while the validation layer seems to be
	unaware of it.

	To learn more about this extension, see:

	- [VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation in Vulkan specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation)
	- [VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation unofficial manual](http://asawicki.info/articles/VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation.php5)



	\page general_considerations General considerations

	\section general_considerations_thread_safety Thread safety

	- The library has no global state, so separate #VmaAllocator objects can be used
	independently.
	There should be no need to create multiple such objects though - one per `VkDevice` is enough.
	- By default, all calls to functions that take #VmaAllocator as first parameter
	are safe to call from multiple threads simultaneously because they are
	synchronized internally when needed.
	- When the allocator is created with #VMA_ALLOCATOR_CREATE_EXTERNALLY_SYNCHRONIZED_BIT
	flag, calls to functions that take such #VmaAllocator object must be
	synchronized externally.
	- Access to a #VmaAllocation object must be externally synchronized. For example,
	you must not call vmaGetAllocationInfo() and vmaMapMemory() from different
	threads at the same time if you pass the same #VmaAllocation object to these
	functions.

	\section general_considerations_allocation_algorithm Allocation algorithm

	The library uses following algorithm for allocation, in order:

	-# Try to find free range of memory in existing blocks.
	-# If failed, try to create a new block of `VkDeviceMemory`, with preferred block size.
	-# If failed, try to create such block with size/2, size/4, size/8.
	-# If failed and #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_CAN_MAKE_OTHER_LOST_BIT flag was
	specified, try to find space in existing blocks, possilby making some other
	allocations lost.
	-# If failed, try to allocate separate `VkDeviceMemory` for this allocation,
	just like when you use #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_DEDICATED_MEMORY_BIT.
	-# If failed, choose other memory type that meets the requirements specified in
	VmaAllocationCreateInfo and go to point 1.
	-# If failed, return `VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DEVICE_MEMORY`.

	\section general_considerations_features_not_supported Features not supported

	Features deliberately excluded from the scope of this library:

	- Data transfer - issuing commands that transfer data between buffers or images, any usage of
	`VkCommandList` or `VkCommandQueue` and related synchronization is responsibility of the user.
	- Allocations for imported/exported external memory. They tend to require
	explicit memory type index and dedicated allocation anyway, so they don't
	interact with main features of this library. Such special purpose allocations
	should be made manually, using `vkCreateBuffer()` and `vkAllocateMemory()`.
	- Support for any programming languages other than C/C++.
	Bindings to other languages are welcomed as external projects.

	/** \brief Compacts memory by moving allocations.

	@param pAllocations Array of allocations that can be moved during this compation.
	@param allocationCount Number of elements in pAllocations and pAllocationsChanged arrays.
	@param[out] pAllocationsChanged Array of boolean values that will indicate whether matching allocation in pAllocations array has been moved. This parameter is optional. Pass null if you don't need this information.
	@param pDefragmentationInfo Configuration parameters. Optional - pass null to use default values.
	@param[out] pDefragmentationStats Statistics returned by the function. Optional - pass null if you don't need this information.
	@return VK_SUCCESS if completed, VK_INCOMPLETE if succeeded but didn't make all possible optimizations because limits specified in pDefragmentationInfo have been reached, negative error code in case of error.

	This function works by moving allocations to different places (different
	`VkDeviceMemory` objects and/or different offsets) in order to optimize memory
	usage. Only allocations that are in pAllocations array can be moved. All other
	allocations are considered nonmovable in this call. Basic rules:

	- Only allocations made in memory types that have
	`VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT` flag can be compacted. You may pass other
	allocations but it makes no sense - these will never be moved.
	- You may pass allocations made with #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_DEDICATED_MEMORY_BIT but
	it makes no sense - they will never be moved.
	- Both allocations made with or without #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_MAPPED_BIT
	flag can be compacted. If not persistently mapped, memory will be mapped
	temporarily inside this function if needed.
	- You must not pass same #VmaAllocation object multiple times in pAllocations array.

	The function also frees empty `VkDeviceMemory` blocks.

	After allocation has been moved, its VmaAllocationInfo::deviceMemory and/or
	VmaAllocationInfo::offset changes. You must query them again using
	vmaGetAllocationInfo() if you need them.

	If an allocation has been moved, data in memory is copied to new place
	automatically, but if it was bound to a buffer or an image, you must destroy
	that object yourself, create new one and bind it to the new memory pointed by
	the allocation. You must use `vkDestroyBuffer()`, `vkDestroyImage()`,
	`vkCreateBuffer()`, `vkCreateImage()` for that purpose and NOT vmaDestroyBuffer(),
	vmaDestroyImage(), vmaCreateBuffer(), vmaCreateImage()! Example:

	\code
	VkDevice device = ...;
	VmaAllocator allocator = ...;
	std::vector<VkBuffer> buffers = ...;
	std::vector<VmaAllocation> allocations = ...;

	std::vector<VkBool32> allocationsChanged(allocations.size());
	vmaDefragment(allocator, allocations.data(), allocations.size(), allocationsChanged.data(), nullptr, nullptr);

	for(size_t i = 0; i < allocations.size(); ++i)
	{
	if(allocationsChanged[i])
	{
	VmaAllocationInfo allocInfo;
	vmaGetAllocationInfo(allocator, allocations[i], &allocInfo);

	vkDestroyBuffer(device, buffers[i], nullptr);

	VkBufferCreateInfo bufferInfo = ...;
	vkCreateBuffer(device, &bufferInfo, nullptr, &buffers[i]);

	// You can make dummy call to vkGetBufferMemoryRequirements here to silence validation layer warning.

	vkBindBufferMemory(device, buffers[i], allocInfo.deviceMemory, allocInfo.offset);
	}
	}
	\endcode

	Note: Please don't expect memory to be fully compacted after this call.
	Algorithms inside are based on some heuristics that try to maximize number of Vulkan
	memory blocks to make totally empty to release them, as well as to maximimze continuous
	empty space inside remaining blocks, while minimizing the number and size of data that
	needs to be moved. Some fragmentation still remains after this call. This is normal.

	Warning: This function is not 100% correct according to Vulkan specification. Use it
	at your own risk. That's because Vulkan doesn't guarantee that memory
	requirements (size and alignment) for a new buffer or image are consistent. They
	may be different even for subsequent calls with the same parameters. It really
	does happen on some platforms, especially with images.

	Warning: This function may be time-consuming, so you shouldn't call it too often
	(like every frame or after every resource creation/destruction).
	You can call it on special occasions (like when reloading a game level or
	when you just destroyed a lot of objects).
